<p>In my quest to not be a social asshole, I have learned a lot about the devil that is Ti-dom. When Ti becomes King and Ruler of the ISTP mindset, we often begin to start ordering everything based on the “logical” perspective. Think of social skills as puzzle pieces. We begin to fit the pieces together in a way that makes logical sense. </p>
<p>ISTP: If I say Please and Thank You, I will communicate that I appreciate efforts thus making the other person more willing to assist me.</p>
<p>^This is an example of how the ISTP learns social skills. Very Cause &amp; Effect oriented. </p>
<p>The ISTP categories all areas of life into “Facts” and “Uncertainties”. Facts are trusted and used to make logical conclusions. Uncertainties are either ignored or factored in only when they can be encapsulated in a factual context. Emotions are usually categorized as “Uncertainties”. Because emotions are “Uncertain” we see them as changeable, unstable, not-factual. They cannot be used in factual analysis because they cannot be depending on. Therefore we have a tendency to ignore emotion (including, and perhaps especially, our own) when making a decision. </p>
<p>Our proclivity to use Facts and ignore Uncertainties is what makes us look like assholes half the time. It can cause us not to phrase things in polite, gentle ways because we are focused on communicating the Fact. </p>
<p>Here is a good example:<br>XNFX: When you said X, it made me feel hurt<br>ISTP: But that isn’t what I meant, so you should get over it.</p>
<p>the ISTP saw what they had originally said and meant as a “fact” and what the XNFX heard as a “uncertainty”. The XNFX misunderstood the point, therefore the XNFX did not operate with the Fact, therefore the XNFX needs to change their viewpoint.</p>
<p>How do we ISTP overcome this? (And we do need to overcome it if we want to get laid consistently, or make friends, or interact with family, or work peacefully on the job) (&lt;–adjusted. Happy now, @Erbse ?)</p>
<p>As you learn your partner’s Emotions, begin to categorize them as “Facts”.<br>An example might be, your partner misunderstood you. Their feelings are hurt. Rather than correcting their Uncertainty, accept their emotion as a Fact that must now be pointed out and included in the information.<br>ISTP: My Partner is hurt. This is a fact. It must now be addressed.<br>ISTP: Partner, I can see that you are hurt, and I am sorry you are hurting. I didn’t mean to communicate that to you, I was trying to communicate XYZ.</p>
<p>Now you have dealt with the partner’s emotions and corrected their viewpoint. And now the XNFX wants to have sex with you. This is clearly a win-win.</p>
<p>Hopefully I am making sense here. If any other ISTPs have something to add, please jump in.</p>
