<h2 id="Chapter-One"><a href="#Chapter-One" class="headerlink" title="Chapter One"></a>Chapter One</h2><ul>
<li><p>what you end up remembering isn’t always the same as what you have witnessed 8</p>
</li>
<li><p>Birth, and Copulation, and Death’—that’s what T. S. Eliot says it’s all about. 10</p>
</li>
<li><p>pustular berk with the charisma of a plimsole    17</p>
</li>
<li><p>History is that certainty produced at the point where the imperfections of memory meet the inadequacies of documentation    19</p>
</li>
<li><p>Patrick Lagrange    19</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is often the statement made with an eye to the future that is the most suspect. 20</p>
</li>
<li><p>My “technique” consisted in not having a technique;    21</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some girls allowed more: you heard of those who went in for mutual masturbation, others who permitted “full sex,” as it was known. 23</p>
</li>
<li><p>You’re just romanticising what you haven’t got. The only point of it is to tell you you’re not pregnant.    26</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t let Veronica get away with too much.    28</p>
</li>
<li><p>I’d read somewhere that if you want to make people pay attention to what you’re saying, you don’t raise your voice but lower it: this is what really commands attention    31</p>
</li>
<li><p>most people didn’t experience “the sixties” until the seventies. Which meant, logically, that most people in the sixties were still experiencing the fifties—or, in my case, bits of both decades side by side. Which made things rather confusing.    37</p>
</li>
<li><p>Then I wished him good luck, burnt his letter in an empty grate (melodramatic, I agree, but I plead youth as a mitigating circumstance    40</p>
</li>
<li><p>I plead youth as a mitigating circumstance    40</p>
</li>
<li><p>mental states can be inferred from actions    41</p>
</li>
<li><p>I think the converse is true: that you can infer past actions from current mental states    41</p>
</li>
<li><p>41</p>
</li>
<li><p>Easy come, easy go, she said, and meant it.    43</p>
</li>
<li><p>The bitch, I thought. If there was one woman in the entire world a man could fall in love with and still think life worth refusing, it was Veronica.    46</p>
</li>
<li><p>we make an instinctive decision, then build up an infrastructure of reasoning to justify it. And call the result common sense.    48</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some Englishman once said that marriage is a long dull meal with the pudding served first    49</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Chapter-Two"><a href="#Chapter-Two" class="headerlink" title="Chapter Two"></a>Chapter Two</h2><ul>
<li><p>the reward of merit is not life’s business.    53</p>
</li>
<li><p>History is that certainty produced at the point where the imperfections of memory meet the inadequacies of documentation.    53</p>
</li>
<li><p>I’ve never quite trusted it—as I do events in Greece and Rome, or the British Empire, or the Russian Revolution. Perhaps I just feel safer with the history that’s been more or less agreed upon.    53</p>
</li>
<li><p>53</p>
</li>
<li><p>When we’re young, everyone over the age of thirty looks middle-aged, everyone over fifty antique. And time, as it goes by, confirms that we weren’t that wrong.    54</p>
</li>
<li><p>There’s nothing wrong with being a genius who can fascinate the young. Rather, there’s something wrong with the young who can’t be fascinated by a genius.    54</p>
</li>
<li><p>Un Homme et Une Femme    54</p>
</li>
<li><p>Who was it said that memory is what we thought we’d forgotten?    56</p>
</li>
<li><p>And it ought to be obvious to us that time doesn’t act as a fixative, rather as a solvent.    56</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bigger than nothing, not as big as something.    56</p>
</li>
<li><p>I rarely ended up fantasising a markedly different life from the one that has been mine. I don’t think this is complacency; it’s more likely a lack of imagination, or ambition, or something    57</p>
</li>
<li><p>Margaret used to say that there were two sorts of women: those with clear edges to them, and those who implied mystery. 58</p>
</li>
<li><p>Res ipsa loquitur    62</p>
</li>
<li><p>65</p>
</li>
<li><p>women who aren’t at all mysterious, but are only made so by men’s inability to understand them.    68</p>
</li>
<li><p>It strikes me that this may be one of the differences between youth and age: when we are young, we invent different futures for ourselves; when we are old, we invent different pasts for others.    69</p>
</li>
<li><p>If it isn’t life’s business to reward merit, why should it be life’s business to give us warm, comfortable feelings towards its end?    71</p>
</li>
<li><p>I had a friend who trained as a lawyer, then became disenchanted and never practised. He told me that the one benefit of those wasted years was that he no longer feared either the law or lawyers. And something like that happens more generally, doesn’t it? The more you learn, the less you fear.    71</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Learn” not in the sense of academic study, but in the practical understanding of life. Perh    71</p>
</li>
<li><p>72</p>
</li>
<li><p>the writer was using light in an attempt to reach greater light.    75</p>
</li>
<li><p>It seemed to me that we ought occasionally to be reminded of instability beneath our feet.    77</p>
</li>
<li><p>“I didn’t bring it up. You said I’d lost my hair. And it happens to be a fact that if you’re a very heavy drinker, something in the booze stops your hair falling out.”    78</p>
</li>
<li><p>Time … give us enough time and our best-supported decisions will seem wobbly, our certainties whimsical.    80</p>
</li>
<li><p>our life is not our life, merely the story we have told about our life.    81</p>
</li>
<li><p>our life is not our life, merely the story we have told about our life. Told to others, but—mainly—to ourselves.    81</p>
</li>
<li><p>character resembles intelligence, except that character peaks a little later: between twenty and thirty, say.    88</p>
</li>
<li><p>the log of your journey is much less clear. 89</p>
</li>
<li><p>89</p>
</li>
<li><p>91</p>
</li>
<li><p>95</p>
</li>
<li><p>Right, so you’re feeling guilt towards your ex-wife, who divorced you twenty years ago, and excitement towards an old girlfriend you haven’t seen in forty years. Who said there were no surprises left in life?    100</p>
</li>
<li><p>Who said that thing about the eternal hopefulness of the human heart?    100</p>
</li>
<li><p>late-flowering love    100</p>
</li>
<li><p>the way the couple at the back were holding hands. It didn’t look like amorousness, more defence against the world    106</p>
</li>
<li><p>I thought I could overcome contempt and turn remorse back into guilt, then be forgiven    110</p>
</li>
<li><p>And there’s no fool like an old fool: that’s what my long-dead mother used to mutter when reading stories in the papers about older men falling for younger women,    110</p>
</li>
<li><p>Who was it said that the longer we live, the less we understand?    110</p>
</li>
<li><p>Still, as I tend to repeat, I have some instinct for survival, for self-preservation. And believing you have such an instinct is almost as good as actually having it,    110</p>
</li>
<li><p>Still, as I tend to repeat, I have some instinct for survival, for self-preservation. And believing you have such an instinct is almost as good as actually having it, because it means you act in the same way.     110</p>
</li>
<li><p>if the face contradicts the speaker’s words, we interrogate the face.    115</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remorse, etymologically, is the action of biting again: that’s what the feeling does to you.    116</p>
</li>
<li><p>I was a man against whom backs should be turned. If life did reward merit, then I deserved shunning. 117</p>
</li>
<li><p>120</p>
</li>
<li><p>May you be ordinary, as the poet once wished the newborn baby.    121</p>
</li>
<li><p>The answers hardly seemed of consequence. Not much did. 121</p>
</li>
<li><p>The answers hardly seemed of consequence. Not much did. I thought of the things that had happened to me over the years, and of how little I had made happen. 121</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Tony Webster—He Never Got It.” 121</p>
</li>
<li><p>You get towards the end of life—no, not life itself, but of something else: the end of any likelihood of change in that life.    125</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is accumulation. There is responsibility. And beyond these, there is unrest. There is great unrest.    125</p>
</li>
