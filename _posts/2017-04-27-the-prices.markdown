I was talking to Amy tonight and she told me that most people don't know how much things cost. The conversation kept going and we came to an idea of how useful it is to know the price of something and the aggregated price of it. We came to questions like _how much does it cost to a person X to spend 1h every day on Facebook?_ or _what is the aggregated price you pay for your salt?_

"It's hard to evaluate a thing which prince is hard to measure." was Amy's point. Now I ask myself, is it easier to evaluate a thing which price is easy to measure? If the answear is _yes_ there should be a way to make prices a public information. I say it in the plural because there is a price and the aggregated price of product/service.
